title: Misakey API Documentation

Welcome to our API documentation.

**Remark:** most of the API is described by examples
more than by rigorous formal specification.
For instance when you see a UUID somewhere,
you should understand that the value at this location must be an UUID,
not that it must be *this exact UUID* (which wouldn't make sense anyway).
