title: Boxes
---

Boxes contain *events* that have a *type*.
In practice, most events will be of type `msg.text` or `msg.file`,
corresponding to the sending of messages (with either text or files in it) to the box.
There are however a few other events,
most of them describing a change of the *state* of the box.
[The shape and rules for box events are described here.](/concepts/box-events)


## Creating a Box

### Request

```bash
    POST https://api.misakey.com/boxes
```

_Headers:_
- `Authorization` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): no identity check, just a valid token is required.

_JSON Body:_
```json
    {
      "title": "RequÃªte RGPD FNAC",
      "public_key": "SXvalkvhuhcj2UiaS4d0Q3OeuHOhMVeQT7ZGfCH2YCw"
    }
```

Where `public_key` must be in **unpadded url-safe base64**.

Note that when a box is created, it already contains a first event
of type `create` that contains all the information about the creation of the box.

### Response

_
```bash
    HTTP 201 Created
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/box.json" %}}
```

The most important part is the `id` field
which must be used to interact with the box.

they are created by the backend during the creation of the box.
