title: Box - Boxes
---

Boxes contain *events* that have a *type*.
In practice, most events will be of type `msg.text` or `msg.file`,
corresponding to the sending of messages (with either text or files in it) to the box.
There are however a few other events,
most of them describing a change of the *state* of the box.
[The shape and rules for box events are described here.](/concepts/box-events)


## Creating a Box

### Request

```bash
    POST https://api.misakey.com/boxes

    }
```

Where `public_key` must be in **unpadded url-safe base64**.

of type `create` that contains all the information about the creation of the box.
