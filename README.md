Misakey
=======

[Misakey](https://misakey.com) is the user account solution for people and applications who
value privacy and simplicity. And itâ€™s open source.

You can find more info about Misakey in our [website](https://www.misakey.com) and our [about page](https://about.misakey.com/).

## Technical overview

The project is composed of:
* The API service, crafted with Golang. 
* An instance of **hydra** ([repo](https://github.com/ory/hydra)) to manage our auth protocol

We host the platform on a Kubernetes cluster, so everything we build is done to work in Docker and K8s.
