# Integration Test Tools

Requirements: `pip install requests`

To run the tests, run `python3 -m python_tests` in the **parent** directory of this files' directory.
Said differently, you should see `python_tests/` when you do `ls`.

The package is not called `tests` because this creates conflicts when using the IPython shell.
